# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Updating the Memory Bank documentation to fully capture project scope, context, architecture, and status.

## Recent Changes

- Populated **projectbrief.md** with project name, purpose, goals, and scope.
- Filled **productContext.md** with overview, target users, problems solved, and UX goals.
- Detailed **systemPatterns.md** including architecture overview, design patterns, component relationships, and critical flows.
- Completed **techContext.md** with technologies used, development setup, constraints, dependencies, and tool patterns.
- Updated **progress.md** with working features, remaining tasks, current status, known issues, and decision evolution.

## Next Steps

- Implement robust error handling and validation across UI and backend.
- Develop unit and integration tests for key components and Lambda functions.
- Configure and test the CI/CD pipeline in Amplify Console.
- Add GraphQL subscriptions for real-time quiz updates.
- Polish UI, loading states, and ensure full responsive design.
- Integrate basic analytics and reporting features.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Maintain Memory Bank as the single source of project truth between sessions.
- Continue using AWS Amplify for serverless infrastructure and React with TypeScript for the front end.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Consistent code formatting enforced by Prettier and ESLint.
- TypeScript-first development with React functional components and Hooks.
- List items use hyphens with a space, double quotes for strings, and two-space indentation.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Serverless architecture accelerates provisioning but requires careful error and permission handling.
- Memory Bank documentation ensures continuity and clarity across development sessions and resets.
- AI-driven quiz generation via Lambda is central to MVP value proposition.
