# Progress

## What Works

- React front-end renders all pages and components (Home, Login, CreateQuiz, EditQuiz, QuizAttempt).
- AWS Amplify backend integration (Cognito Auth, AppSync GraphQL API, S3 storage).
- Lambda quizGenerator function processes content and generates question/answer pairs.
- File upload and parsing for PDF and text documents.
- Gamified quiz-taking interface with scoring, feedback, and animations.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement robust error handling and input validation across UI and backend.
- Develop unit and integration tests for critical components.
- Set up and test CI/CD pipeline in Amplify Console.
- Add GraphQL subscriptions for real-time quiz updates.
- Polish UI/loading states and ensure fully responsive design.
- Integrate basic analytics and reporting features.

## Current Status

MVP end-to-end flow is functional: users can authenticate, create quizzes via AI, and attempt quizzes with scoring.

## Known Issues

- Occasional PDF parsing errors for complex documents.
- Sporadic CORS or permission errors in GraphQL/API calls.
- UI loading flicker on slower network connections.
- Minor theming inconsistencies in dark/light modes.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Adopted serverless AWS Amplify architecture for rapid provisioning.
- Chose React with Vite and TypeScript for fast development and build performance.
- Integrated OpenAI within Lambda for AI-driven quiz generation.
- Established Memory Bank approach for project documentation and continuity.
